# Settlers 4 Bot

My attempt to write a bot that can play "The Settlers 4 History Edition" and maybe learn some machine learning stuff anlong the way.
The goal is to create a bot that is able to play against the default Settlers 4 AI and later against humans. 

This project is in a very early stage and is not really functional/useable for non devs at the moment.
